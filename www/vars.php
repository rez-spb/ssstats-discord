 * Paste the output of "sss.php -c yourconf -s" below, outside of this
 * comment-block. Multiple arrays are allowed as long as they all have a unique
 * cid - useful if you want to serve aforementioned pages for multiple channels
 * out of the same directory.
 *
 * TIP 1: Double-check if the path to the database file is correct, meaning,
 *        _as_your_Web_server_sees_it_.
 *
 * TIP 2: Use a cid like "test" if the channel name is "#test". The number sign
 *        will be percent-encoded in the URL which looks bad. Remember to have
 *        the same cid in sss.conf and this file.
